# FlowerClassification-with-DeepLearning

Welcome to the BreadcrumbsFlowerClassification-with-DeepLearning project! In this repository, we explore various machine learning approaches for classifying the five distinct classes within the flower dataset. Through a series of experiments and techniques, we showcase the power of deep learning in accurately categorizing flowers.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to classify flowers into five distinct classes using different machine learning techniques. We present the results of four different approaches:

Custom Model: An initial custom-designed model achieved an accuracy of 76% in classifying the flower dataset.
VGG19 Transfer Learning with Fine Tuning: Utilizing the VGG19 pre-trained model with fine-tuning improved the accuracy to 79.3%.
VGG19 Transfer Learning (No Fine Tuning): Notably, the accuracy increased further to 80% when using VGG19 without fine-tuning.
Xception Transfer Learning: The Xception model, a deep convolutional neural network, achieved an impressive accuracy of 88%.

# Project Highlights
Machine Learning Approaches: We explore multiple techniques to tackle the flower classification task, showcasing the versatility and power of deep learning models.
